### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With over a year of dedicated experience as a data analyst in Express Service for e-commerce platforms such as TikTok, Shopee, and Shein, along with diverse exposure in non-e-commerce sectors, I've honed my analytical prowess in evaluating courier performance within Ho Chi Minh City. My primary role involved meticulously analyzing operational efficiency and devising data-driven strategies to elevate service quality standards. Proficient in advanced Excel functionalities, Power Query, and PowerPoint, I've effectively translated complex data into actionable insights. Moreover, my expertise extends to SQL for data manipulation, Power BI for interactive visualization, and foundational Python for automation and data manipulation tasks. I am now eagerly seeking a new opportunity where I can leverage my multifaceted skill set and passion for analytics to drive impactful outcomes.
